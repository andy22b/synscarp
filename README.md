# synscarp

Code to create synthetic fault scarps in DEMs, with an example for a fault scarp in the Waiau Toa | Clarence Valley, Aotearoa-New Zealand

## Installation
The easiest way to install this module is using Miniforge (https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/). See https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#id2 for instructions on creating a conda environment.

## Waiau Toa example
An example jupyter notebook is found in `clarence_example/clarence_example.ipynb`. 
To run, this script will require a DEM in geotiff format (in this case, in the NZTM/EPSG:2193 coordinate system) and a single line shapefile representing the fault trace (in the same *Cartesian* coordinate system as the DEM).

Apologies for teh lack of detail in these instructions. If you are considering using this code, please get in touch and I will be happy to guide you through the coade.
